It is used to differentiate between individual cars in the dataset, providing a reference point for each vehicle. |\n",
    "| **mpg**        | Fuel efficiency measured in miles per gallon. 1 Gallon = 3,785411784 liters      | MPG stands for \"Miles per Gallon,\" which measures the fuel efficiency of the car. It indicates how far the car can travel on one gallon of fuel. A higher MPG value typically reflects better fuel economy, which is a key factor for buyers looking to reduce fuel costs and minimize their environmental impact. 1 Gallon is equivalent to 3.785411784 liters. |\n",
    "| **cylinders**  | Number of cylinders in the engine.                                              | This column represents the number of cylinders in the engine. The number of cylinders affects the engine's power output and efficiency. Cars with more cylinders typically have more power, but they may also consume more fuel, while cars with fewer cylinders tend to be more fuel-efficient. |\n",
    "| **displacement**| Engine displacement, indicating its size or capacity.                            | Engine displacement refers to the total volume of all the cylinders in an engine, usually measured in liters or cubic inches. It gives an indication of the engine’s size and its potential to produce power. Larger displacement engines generally provide more horsepower and torque but may be less fuel-efficient. |\n",
    "| **horsepower** | Power output of the engine.                                                     | Horsepower indicates the power output of the car’s engine. It is a measure of the engine's ability to do work, with higher values representing more powerful engines that can achieve faster speeds or handle more strenuous tasks, such as towing. |\n",

Heavier cars tend to have more stability on the road, but they can be less fuel-efficient and slower to accelerate. The weight also plays a role in the car's safety, as heavier vehicles typically provide better protection in collisions. |\n",
    "| **acceleration**| Capability to increase speed, measured in seconds.                              | This column measures the car's ability to accelerate, typically represented by the time it takes to go from 0 to 60 miles per hour (0-100 km/h). Cars with faster acceleration times are generally considered more performance-oriented and can offer a more dynamic driving experience. |\n",
    "| **model_year** | Year of manufacture for the car model.                                          | The model year of the car refers to the year the car was manufactured or the year the model was introduced to the market. This column helps identify the age of the vehicle, which can affect its value, technology, and reliability. |\n",
    "| **origin**     | Country or region of origin for each car.                                       | The origin column indicates the country or region where the car was manufactured or designed.

    "| **name**         | object        | This column is an identifier for each car, and it is of type `object`, which typically means that the data is stored as text or strings. This is appropriate for a column that holds car names or unique identifiers. |\n",
    "| **mpg**          | float64       | The `mpg` (miles per gallon) column is of type `float64`, which indicates that it holds numerical data with decimals. This is appropriate, as fuel efficiency is usually represented with decimal numbers. |\n",
    "| **cylinders**    | int64         | The `cylinders` column is of type `int64`, which means it stores integer values. This is expected since the number of cylinders in an engine is a whole number. |\n",
    "| **displacement** | float64       | The `displacement` column is of type `float64`, which is appropriate because engine displacement can have decimal values (e.g., 2.5 liters). |\n",
    "| **horsepower**   | float64       | The `horsepower` column is of type `float64`, meaning it stores numerical values with decimals. This makes sense since engine power can vary and be expressed with fractional numbers. |\n",
    "| **weight**       | int64         | The `weight` column is of type `int64`, which indicates that the weight of the car is represented as an integer. This is correct, as weight is usually measured in whole units (e.g., kilograms or pounds). |\n",
    "| **acceleration** | float64       | The `acceleration` column is of type `float64`, which makes sense as acceleration times are typically measured with decimal precision (e.g., 8.5 seconds to 60 mph). |\n",
    "| **model_year**   | int64         | The `model_year` column is of type `int64`, which is appropriate since model years are typically represented by whole integers (e.g., 1985, 2020). |\n",
    "| **origin**       | object        | The `origin` column is of type `object`, meaning it holds text data (typically the country or region of origin). This is correct as the origin is generally a categorical variable represented by names (e.g., 'USA', 'Europe', 'Japan'). |"
