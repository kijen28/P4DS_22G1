# Reflection  

## Anh Quân  

### I. Difficulties Encountered  
Throughout the course of this project, several challenges arose that tested both my technical skills and my ability to manage the scope of the project.  
- **Linking columns to address the questions:** One of the major challenges I faced was the difficulty in linking columns from different datasets to answer specific questions. This process required a deeper understanding of the dataset and its structure, as well as a more detailed approach to data cleaning and alignment.  
- **Data overload:** The dataset I worked with contained a large number of columns, making it difficult to pinpoint the most relevant variables for answering the questions posed. This excessive information led to some confusion and complexity when trying to focus on the key features that would yield meaningful insights.  
- **GitHub issues:** Technical difficulties with GitHub also created some setbacks. My laptop experienced errors that prevented me from using GitHub effectively, which delayed version control management and collaboration within the team.  

### II. Lessons Learned  
Despite the challenges, I learned several valuable lessons that have significantly improved my data science skills:  
- **Asking meaningful and relevant questions:** A key takeaway from this project was learning how to frame questions that are not only meaningful but also aligned with the data available. This requires a balance between curiosity and pragmatism, ensuring the questions are both interesting and answerable with the available resources.  
- **Data preprocessing:** I gained significant experience in preprocessing data, which is an essential step in ensuring data quality. I learned how to clean, normalize, and transform raw data into a format suitable for analysis.  
- **Understanding data sources:** This project enhanced my ability to identify valuable sources for datasets and helped me understand the nuances of collecting data for research and practical applications.  
- **Linking columns effectively:** I also developed a better understanding of how to connect different variables in a dataset to derive meaningful insights. The ability to merge, join, and relate data from multiple sources is crucial for conducting thorough analyses and answering research questions.  

## Văn Quyến  

### I. Difficulties Encountered  
- **Data quality issues:** The most significant difficulty I encountered was the poor quality of the data, which had many missing values and inconsistencies. This made the data less reliable and harder to analyze effectively, requiring extensive cleaning and preprocessing.  

### II. Lessons Learned  
- **Simple questions may require thorough exploration:** I learned that some questions, which may seem simple at first, actually require a deeper exploration and more detailed analysis to uncover insightful patterns. This project reinforced the importance of not underestimating the complexity of seemingly straightforward problems.  
- **Formulating relevant questions:** Like my teammate, I learned the importance of asking meaningful and relevant questions. This skill is critical in driving the analysis and ensuring that the work we do is focused on finding practical insights.  

## Future Improvements (If I Had More Time)  
If given additional time, there are several ways I would approach the project differently to improve its quality and focus:  
- **Reselecting the dataset:** I would choose a more focused dataset with a clearer structure and more meaningful columns. This would allow for a more targeted analysis and help avoid the overwhelming complexity caused by irrelevant data.  
- **Asking more insightful questions:** With extra time, I would delve deeper into the dataset, asking more nuanced and insightful questions. This would allow for a more comprehensive analysis, and help uncover deeper patterns and relationships within the data.
